          Thank you for your interest and participation in this yearâ€™s Ken-Ton
          Garden Tour by agreeing to open your garden to visitors on the
          specified days and times of the event. Participating gardens will be
          identified on a map with an accompanying description, both online and
          in the Ken-Ton Garden Tour guidebook; this information will be made
          available to the public. Personal information (e.g., name, phone
          number, email address, etc.) will not be published. Guidebooks will be
          inserted into the Ken-Ton Bee and made available at the Town of
          Tonawanda Aquatic and Fitness Center on the days of the event.
